# Helping Hand

### :handshake: Crowd-Helping Platform because Money Isn't Everything

Inspired by a recent conundrum where I felt weird asking for support via Indiegogo and wanted folks who support the project I was making to mention it to their town administration instead of giving a donation. But I still wanted to give a reward for the help. This also takes inspiration from a volunteer management app I made (CivHub) a long time ago. However I think this will be less intimidating for the civic-tech volunteers and leaders.

Just run `npm install` and `npm start`, then go to localhost:3000 to start developing.
To build, run `npm run build`, and to preview run `npm run preview`, then go
to localhost:1234 for the minified production bundle.

Won't work since I didn't push up some config files.

### :tada: React, React-Router@next, MobX and Webpack 2.
Branched off from this boiler plate http://boilerplate.mhaagens.me since I wanted to play with RR4 & MobX
