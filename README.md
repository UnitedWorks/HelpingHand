# Helping Hand

### :handshake: Crowd-Helping Platform because Money Isn't Everything

Inspired by a recent conundrum where I felt weird asking for monetary support via Indiegogo, but wanted to ask for community support. In my case, that meant having folks mention the bot I was making to their town administration instead of giving me some donation, but still giving a reward for the help. It also takes some inspiration from a volunteer management app I made (CivHub) a long time ago, which was a bit too intense for Code for America Brigades and their members.

Just run `npm install` and `npm start`, then go to localhost:3000 to start developing.
To build, run `npm run build`, and to preview run `npm run preview`, then go
to localhost:1234 for the minified production bundle.

Won't work since I didn't push up some config files.

### :tada: React, React-Router@next, MobX and Webpack 2.
Branched off from this boiler plate http://boilerplate.mhaagens.me since I wanted to experiment with RR4 + Mobx + Firebase
